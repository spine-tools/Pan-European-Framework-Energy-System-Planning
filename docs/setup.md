# Model Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to configure your energy system model using the `userconfig.yaml` file. This configuration file allows you to customize model behavior, select technologies, define constraints, and specify which sectors to include in your analysis.

## Overview

The `userconfig.yaml` file is structured into several main sections that control different aspects of the model:

- **Pipelines**: Enable/disable major model components
- **Countries**: Specify geographical scope and wind zones
- **Model Settings**: Define model type, temporal resolution, and planning years
- **Timeline**: Set historical periods and clustering options
- **Global Constraints**: Configure CO₂ budgets and renewable targets
- **Commodities**: Define energy carriers and their properties
- **Transmission**: Configure transmission networks
- **Cargo**: Enable cargo transport for commodities
- **Storage**: Select storage technologies and investment options
- **Technologies**: Configure power generation, conversion, and end-use technologies
- **End-use**: Define heating and cooling demand sectors
- **Vehicles**: Select transport vehicle types

---

## 1. Pipelines

Control which major sectors and systems are included in the model.

```yaml
pipelines:
  power: True
  vre: True
  hydro: True
  biomass: True
  electricity_transmission: True
  residual_demand: True
  gas: True
  gas_pipelines: True
  industry: True
  heat: True
  transport: True
  cargo: True
```

**Usage**: Set to `True` to include the pipeline in your model, or `False` to exclude it.

**Key Pipelines**:
- `power`: Power generation sector
- `vre`: Variable renewable energy (solar and wind)
- `industry`: Industrial sector modeling
- `heat`: Heat demand and supply
- `transport`: Transportation sector
- `cargo`: Cargo/freight transport

---

## 2. Countries and Wind Zones

Define geographical scope and onshore/offshore wind characteristics.

```yaml
countries:
  Europe:
    onshore: "PECD1"
    offshore: "OFF2"
  ES:
    onshore: "PECD1"
    offshore: "OFF2"
```

**Usage**:
- Use `Europe` as a country code to model all of Europe with default settings
- Add specific country codes (e.g., `ES` for Spain, `DE` for Germany) to customize individual countries
- Wind zone codes (`PECD1`, `OFF2`, etc.) determine the wind resource characteristics

**Available Country Codes**:

```
  countries = [
        "AT",  # Austria
        "BE",  # Belgium
        "BG",  # Bulgaria
        "HR",  # Croatia
        "CY",  # Cyprus
        "CZ",  # Czech Republic
        "DK",  # Denmark
        "EE",  # Estonia

        "NL",  # Netherlands
        "PL",  # Poland
        "PT",  # Portugal
        "RO",  # Romania
        "SK",  # Slovakia
        "SI",  # Slovenia
        "ES",  # Spain
        "SE",  # Sweden

## Validation Checklist

Before running your model, verify:

- [ ] At least one pipeline is enabled
- [ ] Required commodities for enabled pipelines have `status: True`
- [ ] At least one technology is enabled in each active sector
- [ ] CO₂ budgets are realistic for your scenario
- [ ] Planning years are properly configured
- [ ] Country codes are valid
- [ ] Investment methods align with your scenario goals

# WARNINGS
1. Current functionality only models the specified regions in a self-supply manner. It only accounts from non-EU imports those countries that have that connection, e.g., Italy has gas imports from North Africa.
2. No all the technologies and options are introduced here, explore the file to check the whole catalogue.
3. Spatial resolution applies to all sectors. Future development will include models with sectors at different spatial resolution.
4. The configuration files allows to model countries at different spatial resolution however, the networks can be handled at one. So if the user chooses countries with different resolutions, then the networks will not be included and countries will be disconnected.
